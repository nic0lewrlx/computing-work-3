**“Emergency Meeting!"**
   I sighed in annoyance at the sight of the words on my smartwatch. Was it Jiangyou playing pranks again? This was the fifth time today!Grudgingly,I made my way to the hall.       
   "I swear, if I catch Jiangyou pressing the button again, I will-"declared Jaleen angrily.Many others nodded in agreement, as no one liked to climb down flights of stairs and climb up to the sixth floor again upon realising that nothing had happened. Just then, I caught sight of Jiangyou, the infamous class clown, running into the hallway while panting.
   
   He was followed by a weeping Le Xuan, who held a white blanket in her hands. Whispers echoed throughout the hall as Le Xuan gingerly placed the  blanket on the long marble table, only to reveal a bloody mess inside.
    
   "M...My dog Lucky was k..killed. Who can be so cruel as to do such an evil deed?" wailed Le Xuan.
    
   Some of Le Xuan's friends went to comfort her, while the investigative chairperson, Yan Ching, asked:"Where did you find Lucky's body?"
